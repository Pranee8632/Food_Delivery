While both Express and Axios are used in Node.js development, they serve different purposes: Express is a web application framework for building servers and managing routes, while 
Axios is a dedicated library specifically designed to make HTTP requests to external servers, meaning you need Axios to fetch data from other APIs or services within your Node.js application, even if you are using Express to build your backend server.
